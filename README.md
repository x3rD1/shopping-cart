# Shopping Cart Project

This project is a React-based Shopping Cart application built to practice and strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals â€” particularly state management, routing, and data fetching using hooks like useState, useEffect, useParams and useOutletContext.

## Features

- **React Router Integration**
  - Multi-page setup including:
    - Home page
    - Shop page
    - Product detail page
    - Shopping cart page
    - Error handling page
  - Dynamic product routes powered by useParams
- **State Management with Hooks**
  - Uses useState to handle filters, cart items, and UI updates
  - Updates and re-renders UI dynamically based on user interactions
- **Data Fetching**
  - Fetches product data from an API using useEffect
  - Displays a loading state before rendering data
- **Shared States Between Routes**
  - Implements useOutletContext for passing data between nested routes
- **Responsive Layouts**
  - Fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop

## Purpose

This project was built to:

- Strengthen my understanding of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useParams`, `useOutletContext`)
- Practice **React Router** for navigation and dynamic route parameters
- Improve skills in **state management** and **data-driven UI rendering**
- Structure a React project with clean, modular, and reusable components

## What I Learned

- Managing and sharing state between components
- Fetching and handling asynchronous data
- Implementing **dynamic URLs** using `useParams`
- Using **React Router nesting** and context passing
- Handling **conditional rendering** for loading and empty states

## Tech Stack

- React
- React Router v6
- CSS Modules
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vite
